# This file contains a series of control points for you to read in for defining splines.
# The file has the following structure:
# One integer denoting the number of splines ("nSplines") defined within the file.
# 1
# For each spline:
# One integer denoting the number of control points for this spline.
# 12
# One float denoting the number of seconds over which to move the object from start to finish.
# 10.0
# For each point:
#   Three floats denoting X, Y, Z position.
# 0.0, 0.0, 0.0
#   Three floats denoting XRot, YRot, ZRot Euler angles for orientation.
# 0.0, 0.0, 0.0
#
# Repeat for each spline.
